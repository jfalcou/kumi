## Container Type (Type Constructors)
A **Container Type** is a **Type Constructor**; it is not a type itself but a function that takes a type \f$ T \f$ and returns a new type \f$ F(T) \f$.

* **Generics:** In C++, these are implemented via Templates.
* **Structure:** It defines the "shape" of the data (e.g., `std::vector`, `std::list`) independently of the contained value.
